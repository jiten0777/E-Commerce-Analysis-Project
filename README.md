# **Superstore Data Analysis Project**

Welcome to the **Superstore Data Analysis** project! In this project, I analyzed a sample superstore dataset to gain insights into sales, profit, and customer segments. This project provides detailed visualizations and analysis using Python libraries like `Pandas`, `Plotly`, and `Matplotlib`.

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to uncover meaningful trends in the **Superstore dataset**, which contains sales, profit, and product category data. The analysis includes:
- Sales trends by month
- Profitability insights by category and sub-category
- Comparison of sales vs profit across different customer segments
- Sales-to-profit ratios for customer segments
- Detailed visualizations using interactive charts

## **Key Insights**
- **Monthly Sales Trends**: The analysis tracks the sales trends across different months and identifies patterns such as peak sales periods.
- **Sales by Sub-Category**: This helps in identifying the sub-categories that contribute the most to total sales, providing key insights for inventory and marketing strategies.
- **Profit by Category and Sub-Category**: A detailed breakdown of profit margins across various product categories and sub-categories, assisting in profitability analysis and decision-making.
- **Sales vs. Profit by Customer Segment**: Visualizing the relationship between sales and profit for different customer segments, which can help prioritize high-margin and high-volume segments.
- **Sales-to-Profit Ratio by Segment**: This ratio offers insights into the efficiency of converting sales into profit for each segment, helping in optimizing sales strategies.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.x**
- `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
- `Plotly` for interactive visualizations


## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is from a sample **Superstore dataset**, which contains information on orders, products, categories, sub-categories, sales, and profits.

The data columns include:
- **Order Date**: Date of the order
- **Ship Date**: Date the order was shipped
- **Sales**: Revenue from the order
- **Profit**: Profit generated from the order
- **Segment**: Customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
- **Category**: Product category (e.g., Office Supplies, Technology, Furniture)
- **Sub-Category**: Product sub-category (e.g., Binders, Phones, Chairs)

## **Steps Followed in the Analysis**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
    - Converted date columns to datetime format for better manipulation.
    - Extracted relevant features such as `Order Month`, `Order Year`, and `Order Week of Day`.
2. **Sales & Profit Analysis**: 
    - Grouped data by various categories such as `Month`, `Sub-Category`, `Category`, and `Segment` to calculate total sales and profits.
3. **Data Visualization**: 
    - Created **line charts**, **bar charts**, **pie charts**, and **scatter plots** using `Plotly` to provide visual insights into the data.
4. **Insights Extraction**: 
    - Generated insights on sales and profit performance, identifying trends, top-selling products, and profitable customer segments.



## **Graphs & Visualizations**
- **Monthly Sales Trend**: Line chart showing the sales trend for each month.
- **Sales Analysis by Sub-Category**: Bar chart to visualize total sales per sub-category.
- **Profit by Category**: Bar chart showing the total profit per category.
- **Sales vs Profit by Customer Segment**: Grouped bar chart comparing sales and profit by customer segment.
- **Sales-to-Profit Ratio**: Bar chart showing the sales-to-profit ratio for each customer segment.

## **Future Improvements**
- Implement additional analyses like **forecasting** future sales trends using machine learning models.
- Enhance the visualizations with more **interactive filters** for better user experience.
- Add more **metrics** such as **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **Churn Rate**.
